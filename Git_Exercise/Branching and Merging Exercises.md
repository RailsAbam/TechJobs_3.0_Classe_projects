# Branching and Merging Exercises PART I

1.Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory.

2.If you are dealing with an untracked or unmerged file, you cannot use git checkout to remove it from the working directory. You must use git clean -df to remove these files.

3.The merge commit continues to have two parents. Note: There is nothing right or wrong of either one of the strategies but with fast forward merge you have a straight line of history and with the recursive merge, it is of multiple lines.

4.git branch (branchname)

5.git switch (branchame)

6.git rm --cached NAME_OF_FILE

7.git branch -d (branchname)

8.Diff command is used in git to track the difference between the changes made on a file.

9.git reset --hard HEAD

10.git merge BRANCH-NAME
